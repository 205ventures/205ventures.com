						<h3>Our Mission</h3>
						<p><strong>205Ventures</strong> is built under the principle of helping small businesses as well as students.</p>
						<p>We are helping small businesses to keep up with the fast pace of their consumer's demand. This means that we are 
						using the latest technology and S.O.E campaigns to reach more consumers within a specific area.</p>

						<p><strong>205Ventures</strong> is founded by current students working on their bachelors degree. We understand
						every student feels and we are helping them by offering on the filed experience. In return we offer recomendations
						letters and a compesantion depending on the skills needed on a project.</p>

						<p>Our goal is to have successful partners that can relay on us for their technology needs and online marketing 
						strategies. We do not work with clients, we work with family.</p>
